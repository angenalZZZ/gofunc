// This is a basic example of how to use longpoll.
//
// In this example, we'll generate some random events and provide a way for
// browsers to subscribe to those events.
//
// To run this example:
//   go build examples/basic/basic.go
// Then run the binary and visit http://127.0.0.1:8081/basic
//
// A couple of notes:
//   - In this example, event payloads are string data, but they can be anything
//     that is convert-able to JSON (passes encoding/json's Marshal() function)
//
//   - LongpollManager.SubscriptionHandler is directly bound to a http handler.
//     But there's no reason why you can't wrap that handler in your own
//     function to add a layer of validation, access control, or whatever else
//     you can think up.  See the advanced example on how to do this.
//
//   - Our events are simple and randomly generated in a goroutine, but you can
//     create events anywhere and anyhow as long as you pass a reference to the
//     LongpollManager and just call Publish().  Maybe you have a goroutine that
//     checks the weather, a stock price, or something cool.  Or you can even
//     have another http handler that calls Publish().  To do this, you must
//     capture the manager reference in a closure.  See the advanced example.
